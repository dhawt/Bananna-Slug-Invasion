Bananna-Slug-Invasion
=====================

A SDL/Linux clone of Dr. Mario.  I wrote this back in 2002 for kicks.  Haven't tried compiling it in years, but uploaded here for posterity. :)

All code and graphics (for better or worse) by me.  Even includes some rudimentary networked multiplayer support. (What fun!)

There is code in there for custom font rendering which someone, somewhere, may find useful.  These days there is little need for that.

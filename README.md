Bananna-Slug-Invasion
=====================

A SDL/Linux clone of Dr. Mario.  I wrote this back in 2002 for kicks.  Haven't tried compiling it in years, but uploaded here for posterity. :)

All code and graphics (for better or worse) by me.  Even includes some rudimentary networked multiplayer support. (What fun!)
